FibonacciUser.java is used to calulate nth fibonacci number using four different methods mentioned below:

fibIterative() --> method uses iterative technique

fibOriginalRecursive() --> original recursive method already provided in lab

fibFormula() --> uses formula technique

fibMyRecursive() --> my method to calculate fibonacci number using recursion technique


The worstTime(n) and run time analysis is mentioned in file LAB07.doc
